# mythicdb
Mythic Database is precisely that... a database filled with mythic figures, items, and legends.

Right now, MythicDB is a work in early development. And, by early development, read: can we really call a collection of shoddily tossed together Excel spreadsheets a "database"? (Dear DB folks, please don't worry... I know it is. No, it isn't. Yes. No. Stop it!) <br />

<h2>Short-Term Goals</h2>
<ul><li>continue compiling terms, authors, works</li><br />
<li>update lists</li></ul>

<h2>Long-Term Goals</h2> 
<ol><li>build website</li><br />
<li>build app with the 3400+ mythical terms - searches the web for definition & synopsis, citation(s), URL(s), and modern usage (if applicable, relevant, or possible).</li><br />
<li>connect other Excel lists (ancient & modern authors, etc.) to the appropriate citations section of the MythicDB app "display results" page.</li><br />
<li>app needs three screens: search, display, contact.</li><br />
<li>website needs four pages: home, downloads, contact, terms.</li></ol><br />
