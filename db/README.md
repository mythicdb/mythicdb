Hello Zeemz Quester!

Welcome to the PuzzleR Party. We're collating a massive open source database of mythic beings from around the globe. 

Current TODO list:

1. Move xslx files here
2. Copy gsheet files here
3. Transfer files into a fully functioning DB (MariaDB, noSQL, RedisDB)
4. Create PyScrapper to read MythicDB and to call sources (wikipedia, mythology
5. Create React app for users to access the MythicDB
